# The pipeline contains the ConveRTFeaturizer that provides pre-trained word embeddings of the user utterance.
# However, ConveRT is only available in English.

## If your training data is not in English, but you still want to use pre-trained word embeddings
## Then use this, for better understanding go to Rasa docs pipeline section, you'll get like this
    #  - name: SpacyNLP
    #  - name: SpacyTokenizer
    #  - name: SpacyFeaturizer
## It uses the SpacyFeaturizer instead of the ConveRTFeaturizer.
## SpacyFeaturizer provides pre-trained word embeddings from either GloVe or fastText in many different languages.
